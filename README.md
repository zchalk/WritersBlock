## Writer's Block

Writer's Block is an application designed to help writers who are experiencing a creative slowdown. Users are asked to create a profile or sign in and given random writing prompts and have the ability to save their prompts to view at a later time.


This application was created using handlebars, CSS, Javascript, and a writer's block database. Dependencies include: bcrypt, connect-session-sequelize, dotenv, express, express-handlebars, express-session, mysql2, seed, sequelize.

## User Story

As a user I am stuck on what to write next. I want to be given random writing prompts with the ability to save what I have written and review it at a later time.
